# Use Cognito authorizer to authenticate users using the Bookshelf API Gateway

In the prevoius steps we created
- a user in IAM
- an S3 bucket
- a DynamoDB table
- a Lambda function
- an API Gatway endpoint
- a Cognito user pool

Now we will take two steps back and will deploy our SAM template with some parameters which will create us a new API Gateway REST API. It will also set the created User Pool as authorizer for it. After this we also need to update our webpage content so it would use the new endpoint and the corect user pool.

## Deploying SAM with condition

Our `SAM` template is prepared in such a way that in case if we provide a value for the `BookshelfUserPoolArn` parameter then it will deploy for us an API Gateway with a Cognito authorizer.
`API Gateway` provides built-in support for using `Cognito user pools` as an `authorizer` for your APIs. This allows you to add authentication and authorization to your APIs using Cognito, without having to write any custom code. When you enable Cognito authorizer for your API Gateway endpoints, API Gateway will `automatically validate JWT tokens` generated by Cognito user pools, and grant or deny access to your APIs based on the token's claims. This makes it easy to secure your APIs and control access to your resources.

To make this deployment easier you just need to use the `/lambda/bookshelf/build_deploy_with_api.bat` file. It will do the build and deplyoment for you. What you just need to provide is the parameter of the Cognito User Pool:
```
build_deploy_with_api.bat <cognito_user_pool_arn>
```
The User Pool ARN was noted down after the creation with CDK at [Cognito section](/cognito/cognito.md#user-pool-arn).

After successful execution you will have a new Lambda function with a connected and protected API Gateway endpoint.

```
Note down the enpoint which you receive at the Value field.

## Updating the S3 static webpage

We arrived at the final preparation steps to have our end-to-end serverless Bookshelf application fully functional.

We need to specify in the `Javascript` code of our web page the API Gateway endpoint, Cognito User Pool Id and then we will also need to create a test user with which we can sign in into our application.

### Update the books.html

In the `s3` directory execute the `up_books_html.py`:
```
python up_books_html.py <api_gateway_url>
```
The `api_gateway_url` is the one which you noted down at [Noting down the API endpoint](/apigw/auth.md#api-endpoint)

### Update the index.html

Go to the `cognito` directory and execute:
```
get_pools.bat
```
This will provide you with the `user pool id` and `app client id` values.
>**Note**
>In case you have other User Pools already created you need to lookup these values manually.


In the `s3` directory execute the `up_index_html.py`:
```
python up_index_html.py <user_pool_id> <app_client_id>
```
